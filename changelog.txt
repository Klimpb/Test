* Added sorting
* New field, "order" requires a number or nil decides the order that something is displayed in. If you're using grouping then the order only matters for that group, and wont influence the order that groups are shown in
* New type, "groupOrder", { type = "groupOrder", group = <text>, order = # }, lets you control the order groups are displayed in. The area that you specify groupOrder in doesn't matter, it can be done before, after or in the middle of the widget table.

* Dropdowns now support multiple options being checked, pass "multi" to enable, the variable is formated as table[key] = true for each selected value, so if you pass vars = { "foo", "bar" } then it becomes config["foo"]["bar"][key] = true and so on

* Recoded drop downs so they're now fulled unnamed and have less issues with large strings of text being put inside them, they'll also now use a scroll frame when they have more then 10 rows inside so when trying to show something that has a lot of rows like textures or status bars, it'll no longer overflow.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r271 | shadowed.wow | 2007-10-21 18:27:56 -0700 (Sun, 21 Oct 2007) | 1 line

* Added HAObj:InjectUIObject(obj, data) obj is the actual object to display, data is either group, yPos or xPos for manipulating location if need be
* Added inject type for CreateConfiguration, arguments are { type = "inject", widget = obj, <data>}
* Hopefully, fixed group height and will no longer have it overlapping on the last widget

------------------------------------------------------------------------
r182 | shadowed.wow | 2007-09-17 15:49:37 -0700 (Mon, 17 Sep 2007) | 6 lines

* Should probably add OptionHouse because we require it now
* Removed some old error messages
* Widget creation has been changed (no major bump as this is backwards compatible), removed the idea of stages, when you call HAObj:GetFrame() will return the frame as normal and also save how many widgets were saved. If you call it again and total widgets hasn't changed we simply return the frame without positioning.

If you added more widgets and call HAObj:GetFrame() again then we clear all points/position all the widgets like normal and return the frame.

* New API, HAObj:UpdateDropdown( { var = var, default = default, list = list } ) arguments work the same as CreateDropdown, default and list will be updated to the passed values, var is used to find the specific dropdown
* New API, HA:GetObject(frame) turns a frame from HAObj:GetFrame() into HAObj
* Fixed an argcheck that wasn't allowing numbers to be used as the default for dropdowns

* MAJOR HAS BEEN BUMPED TO HousingAuthority-1.2
* Added maxChars = # to CreateInput, just calls SetMaxLetters(maxChars)
* Added manualInput = boolean to CreateSlider, creates an input next to the slider that can have the number entered manually, still a few kinks with this
* Fixed a couple of argchecks
------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fixed entries in the dropdown all appearing as checked
* Fixed color picker not showing up in front of the OptionHouse frame
* Fixed column positioning code will work a lot better now

r156 | shadowed.wow | 2007-09-05 00:11:40 -0700 (Wed, 05 Sep 2007) | 3 lines

* Removed calls to OptionHouseFrames.*, we now create our own instance of OptionHouse so we can call GetFrame. You MUST make sure OptionHouse loads before HousingAuthority.lua
* Added CreateButton which, suprisingly enough creates a button table data accepts var, set, text like everything else, you can also add template to change the style, or width to customize the width instead of using the texts size
* Updated HouseBuilder to use a button as an example too
------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Grouping should be fully implemented now and work perfectly
* Added in columns support, pass columns = # into the frameData table, right now only 1 and 2 will support any mixing of frame types, when you get into 3 you'll need to specifically order the frame types so they fit together
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
r142 | shadowed.wow | 2007-08-29 15:11:01 -0700 (Wed, 29 Aug 2007) | 5 lines

* Build script (Stolen from OptionHouse and broken horribly I assume now)
* Added in the grouping code, you can define a group by adding group = "Header text" in each widget, once you define one widget as in a group all the others must be too
* Changed frame data positionType to columns, 1 shows one by one, 2 uses 2 columns and so on, you really shouldn't go over 3
* Changed font for help/error to GameFontNormalSmall (trial)
* Help is now green, error is red (also trial)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Basic group code in so I can continue work on it tomorrow
* Groups can have some small changes, either by calling HAObj:CreateGroup({text = "This is an example group", background = { r = 1, g = 1, b = 1}, border = { r = 0, g = 0, b = 0}}) or calling it as a group type in CreateConfiguration

Group text must match up with all the other widgets in the same group or else they wont be added, they'll wrap around all the widgets in it's group and be given a label/backdrop
------------------------------------------------------------------------

r117 | shadowed.wow | 2007-08-24 21:33:52 -0700 (Fri, 24 Aug 2007) | 5 lines

* Renamed CreateFontString to CreateLabel, it'll increase the yPos between the row above and below it so it can be used as a "category" header
* Added a basic help/validate display, it'll likely change or be tweaked later but it's usable
* Fixed up everything

With this, it's beta but not production beta, see HouseBuilder.lua for API examples will get a wiki page up somepoint.
